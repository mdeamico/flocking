# Flocking Simulation
Inspired by the "Hour of Code" challenge https://code.org/learn, in particular this one on [Flocking](https://tech.io/playgrounds/1003/flocking-autonomous-agents/introduction?utm_source=code-org&utm_campaign=HOC2017&utm_term=flocking-agents) from which I re-factored a lot of the code from and updated it to ES6.


Also inspired by Dan Schiffman, who released a video on the topic shortly after I started my project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtUV-DoSOpk
